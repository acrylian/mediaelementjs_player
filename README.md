mediaelementjs_player
=====================

A Zenphoto plugin for the Mediaelementjs player (beta status)

Install in the `/plugins` folder.

Note
----
Originally this plugin was scheduleded to become official plugin with 1.4.5. But we had to skip the idea because the flash fallback for some browser somehow did not work and we didn't know why yet. 

If you wish to use it you need to upload formats for all browsers (mp4/mp3, webm, ogg). Because of Flash it will not work in older browsers currently.

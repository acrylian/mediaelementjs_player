mediaelementjs_player
=====================

A Zenphoto plugin for the Mediaelementjs player (beta status)

Originally schedulede to become an official plugin with 1.4.5 but taken out because the flash fallback for some browser somehow does not work and we don't know why yet. If you wish to use it you need to upload formats for all browsers (mp4/mp3, webm, ogg). Because of Flash it will not work in older browsers.

Install in the `/plugins` folder.

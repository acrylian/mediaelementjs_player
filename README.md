mediaelementjs_player
=====================

Mediaelementjs player plugin draft for Zenphoto

Originally schedulede to become an official plugin with 1.4.5 but taken out because the flash fallback for some browser somehow does not work and we don't know why.

If you wish to use it you need to upload formats for all browsers (mp4, webm, ogg). Because of Flash it will not work in older browsers.
